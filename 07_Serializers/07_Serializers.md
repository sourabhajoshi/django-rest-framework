# Module Serializer in DRF

**What is Serializer?**

Manual way to define serialization logic. You define each field explicitly. Use when you're not using Django models or want full control.
```
from rest_framework import serializers

class BookSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    title = serializers.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = serializers.CharField(max_length=100)
    published = serializers.DateField()
```

**What is ModelSerializer?**

A shortcut for creating serializers using Django models Automatically generates fields based on model. Less boilerplate code.
```
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Book

class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = '__all__'
```

**Diff b/w ModelSerializer and Serializer**

| Feature           | `Serializer`      | `ModelSerializer`                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Field Definition  | Manual            | Auto from model                     |
| Boilerplate       | More              | Less                                |
| Model Integration | Not tied to model | Tightly integrated with model       |
| Flexibility       | More control      | Less control, but easy to customize |

**What is Meta class?**

Nested class used in ModelSerializer.

Tells serializer:
- Which model to use
- Which fields to include/exclude
```
class Meta:
    model = Book         # your Django model
    fields = '__all__'   # or list of field names
```

**How to include fields in ModelSerializer?**
```
class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'author']
```

**How to exclude fields?**
```
class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        exclude = ['created_at', 'updated_at']
```

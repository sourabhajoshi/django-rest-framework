# Understanding of API

API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It acts like a middleman that allows two different software systems to talk to each other.

API is a bridge that lets one app use features of another app without building them from scratch.

**Example: Uber and Google Maps**
* Uber is one application (project).
* Google Maps is another separate application.

When you book a ride in Uber, it shows you the map, your route, and nearby drivers but Uber didn't create the map itself.

Instead, Uber uses Google Maps API to access map features like location, directions, traffic, etc.

How it works:
* Uber sends a request to Google Maps API like:
  "Show me the location of the user and the route to the    destination."
* Google Maps API responds with the map data.
* Uber shows this data to the user.

**Example: Restaurant and API**

The Setup:
* Customer = Your app (like Uber, Facebook, etc.)
* Waiter = API (middleman)
* Kitchen = The server or another system (like Google Maps, database, etc.)

You (the customer) sit at a table and look at the menu. You tell the waiter (API) what you want to eat. The waiter (API) goes to the kitchen (server) and tells the chef your order. The kitchen prepares the food. The waiter (API) brings the food back to your table.

In software terms:
* You make a request using the API.
* The API sends that request to the server.
* The server processes it and sends back the response.
* The API delivers that response to your app.

**Types of APIs**

1. Public API (Open API)

Anyone can access it. Available to the public, often with API v keys. Used to encourage developers to build on top of a service.
Usually well-documented and easy to integrate.

Example:
- Google Maps API – Any app can use it to show maps or directions.
- OpenWeather API – Anyone can use it to get weather data.

2. Partner API

Shared only with selected partners. Not open to the public Requires business agreements or approval. Offers more control over usage and data sharing.

Example:
- Uber & PayPal Integration – Uber uses PayPal's Partner API to offer in-app payments.
- A flight aggregator using APIs from specific airlines to fetch prices and seat availability.

3. Private API (Internal API)

Used only inside a company. Hidden from external developers. Connects internal systems like web frontend and backend. Improves development speed and modularity within an organization.

Example:
- A bank’s internal API used by its own mobile app to fetch account balances.
- Amazon using internal APIs to connect their product, payment, and shipping systems.


| Type    | Access Level          | Who Uses It             | Example                         |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Public  | Open to everyone       | Any developer            | Google Maps API                 |
| Partner | Restricted to partners | Approved third parties   | Uber using PayPal API           |
| Private | Internal only          | Inside the organization  | Internal API for order tracking |

**API Provider vs API Consumer**

1. API Provider
Creates and exposes the API. Handles the logic, data, and functionality behind the scenes. Maintains documentation, authentication, rate limits, etc.

2. API Consumer
Uses the API to access data or features. Sends requests and receives responses from the provider.

# What is a URL

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
It's the web address you enter in a browser to visit a website or access a resource (like an API endpoint, image, or document).
```
https://www.example.com:8080/products/search?q=phone#reviews
```
| Part              | Name               | Explanation                                                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https`           | Protocol (Scheme)  | Tells the browser how to communicate (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP)              |
| `www.example.com` | Domain (Host)      | The web server’s address (domain name or IP address)                       |
| `:8080`           | Port (optional)    | Port number the server is listening on (default is 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS) |
| `/products/search`| Path               | Specific resource or location on the server                                |
| `?q=phone`        | Query String       | Data passed to the server (used for search, filters, etc.)                 |
| `#reviews`        | Fragment (Anchor)  | Points to a section within the page (not sent to the server)               |
